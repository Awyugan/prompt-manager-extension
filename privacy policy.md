# Prompt Manager Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** [ May 28, 2024]

Thank you for using the **Prompt Manager Extension** (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome Extension.

**1. Information We Collect**

We are committed to protecting your privacy.
*   **No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Collected:** This Extension does not collect any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, email address, or any other data that could be used to identify you personally.
*   **Locally Stored Data:** All your settings, custom prompts, and any other data you create or manage within the Extension are stored exclusively on your local device (within your browser's local storage). This data is not transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers.

**2. How We Use Information**

Any information collected (if any, primarily referring to locally stored configuration data) is used solely for the purpose of providing the core functionalities of the Extension and enhancing your user experience. We do not use your information for any other purposes.

Specifically, the permissions requested are used as follows:
*   **`storage`:** To save and manage your Extension settings, custom prompts, and other relevant data locally within your browser.
*   **`activeTab`:** To temporarily access the current active tab when you interact with the Extension (e.g., by clicking the Extension icon) to retrieve page information or execute specific actions.
*   **`scripting`:** To inject content scripts (`content_script.js`) into web pages, enabling the core functionality of prompt injection, editing, and management on those pages.
*   **`contextMenus`:** To add options to your browser's right-click context menu, providing quick access to Extension features.
*   **`notifications`:** To send you notifications for important updates, reminders, or other relevant information related to the Extension.
*   **Host Permissions (`<all_urls>`):** The Extension requires access to all URLs to inject its content scripts (`content_script.js` and `content_script.css`) into web pages. This is essential for the Extension to function across various websites, allowing you to manage prompts directly within those pages.

**3. Information Sharing and Disclosure**

This Extension does not share, sell, rent, or trade any of your data with any third parties.

**4. Data Storage and Security**

Since all data generated and managed by the Extension is stored locally on your device, we do not have direct access to or control over your data. The security of your data primarily depends on your browser's security features and your device's overall security.

**5. Your Choices and Rights**

You can control your data stored by this Extension by managing its settings within your browser. You can delete all locally stored data simply by uninstalling the Extension from your browser.

**6. Children's Privacy**

This Extension is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and will be reflected in the Extension's listing on the Chrome Web Store. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
